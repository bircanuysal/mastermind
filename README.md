## How to Play

In Mastermind, the player, aka the Codebreaker, has to guess a random
sequence of four numbers generated by the computer. The Codebreaker
wins when they guess both the number and order correctly for all four
numbers within a given amount of turns. The breakdown of the different
difficulties is shown below:

| Difficulty | Number Range | Number of Turns |
| :--------: | :----------: | --------------- |
|    Easy    |    0 - 7     | 12              |
|   Normal   |    0 - 7     | 10              |
|    Hard    |    0 - 7     | 8               |
| Dark Souls |    0 - 9     | 6               |

Each guess is made by typing in 4 consecutive numbers in the terminal.
After each guess, the Codebreaker will get feedback on the previous
guess. The feedback is represented in the following symbols:

```
X = Correct number, correct location
O = Correct number, incorrect location
* = Incorrect number, incorrect location
```

For example, if the correct sequence is [1, 9, 0, 2] and the player guesses
[1, 2, 3, 4], the feedback that is given will be:

`X O * *`

- The (1) `X` represents the 1 being the right number in the right position.
- The (1) `O` represents the 2 being the right number, but in the wrong positon.
- The (2) `*` represents 3 and 4 both being incorrect numbers and therefore, not
  belonging on the board.

In another example, if the correct sequence is [3, 3, 6, 9] and the player
guesses [1, 3, 6, 9], the feedback that is given will be:

`X X X *`

- The (3) `X` represents 3, 6 and 9 being the right numbers in the right
  positions.
- The (1) `*` represents the remaining unmatched number 3 being compared with
  the only unmatched guess which is 1, therefore resulting in a mismatch of
  number and position.

## Features

## Leaderboard

Every time a player completes a game, their score is added to the high score.
This leaderboard is saved throughout sessions on the same machine. Many factors
contribute to a better score:

- Whether or not the player has won
- How many seconds it took the player to complete the game
- The difficulty
- Turns remaining after the last guess

To reset the leaderboard to factory settings, run the following command:

`python3 ./data/reset_leaderboard.py`

## Hints

Coming soon!

## Continuous Integration

This repository is set up with a Github Actions workflow to test dependencies,
run a Pyflake linter and validate unittests on every push.

[Check it out here!](./.github/workflows/mastermind.yml)

## Unit Testing

Coming soon!

## To Dos

- Allow users to ask for hints, but at the cost of a score penalty.
- Add multiplayer functionality.
- Unit-testing
